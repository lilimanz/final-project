# Red Flag Detector

**Business Challenge:** Detecting Toxic Comments


## Introduction
The Red Flag Detector, developed by Lydia Manzanares as her final project at Ironhack, aims to address the issue of hateful speech and toxic relationships in both online and personal interactions. By leveraging advanced data science techniques, this innovative application seeks to promote mental health and community well-being by identifying and flagging potentially harmful comments in real-time.

## Project Overview
The Red Flag Detector uses state-of-the-art logistic classification algorithms to analyze comments for toxicity. The main objective is to provide users with a tool that can instantly assess and flag harmful content, thereby fostering a safe and respectful online environment. This project involves building, testing, and deploying a reliable classifier to detect toxic comments.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Classification Technology:** Utilizes logistic classifiers for high-accuracy toxicity assessment.
- **Real-time Analysis:** Offers instant feedback on the presence of harmful content.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed to be simple and accessible, ensuring ease of use.
- **Bulk Comment Analysis:** Allows users to analyze multiple comments simultaneously.

## Data Analysis Tools

The Red Flag Detector project primarily employs Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit for data manipulation, model building, and deployment. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conduct an exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset, identify key statistics, distributions, and patterns. 



## Deliverables

- **Python Code:** Provide well-documented Python code for the entire process, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and deployment.
- **Tableu report** Summarize the findings from the EDA, including visualizations and insights into the dataset. [text](https://public.tableau.com/views/RedFlagDetector-FinalProject/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
- **Presentation** Create a concise presentation summarizing the project's problem statement, findings, and final product. This presentation should be suitable for sharing with stakeholders [text](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGJYTqHlms/L_1ZvpWUHeeSlRCEp0lOfw/view?utm_content=DAGJYTqHlms&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor)
